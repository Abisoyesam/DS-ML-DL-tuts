    "        - A green energy windmill producer need to optimize distribution and need better prediction on production based on weather forecasts.\n",
    "        - An online news media is interested in a story with how CO2 per capita around the world has evolved over the years.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - Both projects are difficult\n",
    "        - For the windmill we would need data on production, maintenance periods, detailed weather data, just to get started.\n",
    "        - The data for CO2 per capita is available on [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.PC), but creating a visual story is difficult with our current capabilities\n",
    "        \n",
    "- Hence, make a better research problem (Start with less ambitious problem)\n",
